# Email as Support Inbox - System Update

## What Changed

### Previous Behavior ‚ùå
- System looked for emails **FROM** specific customers **TO** the org email
- Only processed emails from customers with existing tickets
- Required manual ticket creation first

### New Behavior ‚úÖ
- System fetches **ALL** emails **TO** the support email (`auchingho1@gmail.com`)
- **Every email creates or updates a ticket automatically**
- Support email acts as a universal inbox
- Customers don't need existing tickets

## How It Works Now

### 1. Email Fetching
```
Support Email: auchingho1@gmail.com
Searches: ALL emails TO this address (last 7 days)
Filters: None - every email is processed
```

### 2. Ticket Matching Strategy

The system tries to match incoming emails to existing tickets in this order:

**Priority 1: Email Threading (Most Reliable)**
- Checks `In-Reply-To` header
- Checks `References` header
- If email is replying to a previous message, adds to that ticket

**Priority 2: Subject + Customer Match**
- Normalizes subject (removes Re:, Fwd:, etc.)
- Matches customer email + subject
- If found, adds message to existing ticket

**Priority 3: Create New Ticket**
- If no match found, creates a brand new ticket
- Uses email subject as ticket title
- Customer email becomes the ticket's customer

### 3. Automatic Ticket Creation

Every email that doesn't match an existing ticket creates:
- **New Conversation (Ticket)** with:
  - Subject from email
  - Customer email from sender
  - Status: ACTIVE
  - Priority: MEDIUM
  - Channel: EMAIL

- **First Message** with:
  - Content from email
  - Sender info
  - External ID (email message ID)
  - Timestamp

### 4. Notifications

When a new ticket is created or updated:
- ‚úÖ Notification is sent to all org users
- ‚úÖ Appears in notification bell
- ‚úÖ Includes direct link to ticket
- ‚úÖ Shows customer and subject

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Brand New Customer
```
Customer: newcustomer@example.com
Sends to: auchingho1@gmail.com
Subject: "Help with login"

Result:
‚úÖ New ticket created: "Help with login"
‚úÖ Customer: newcustomer@example.com
‚úÖ Status: ACTIVE
```

### Scenario 2: Existing Customer, Different Topic
```
Customer: john@example.com (has existing ticket "Payment issue")
Sends to: auchingho1@gmail.com
Subject: "Account settings question"

Result:
‚úÖ New ticket created: "Account settings question"
‚úÖ Both tickets are active
‚úÖ Customer: john@example.com
```

### Scenario 3: Reply to Existing Thread
```
Customer: sarah@example.com
Replies to ticket "Shipping delay"
In-Reply-To: <original-message-id>

Result:
‚úÖ Message added to existing "Shipping delay" ticket
‚úÖ Notification sent for ticket reply
‚úÖ Ticket updated timestamp
```

### Database Schema
No changes required - works with existing schema:

### Email Poller
- Still runs every 60 seconds

2. They send emails with their questions
3. System automatically creates tickets
4. Reply to tickets from the dashboard
5. Customers receive replies via email

### For Testing
```bash
# Send test email TO: auchingho1@gmail.com

```
