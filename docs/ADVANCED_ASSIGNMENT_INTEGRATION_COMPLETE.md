## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Database Queries:
- Single query to fetch users with JOIN to tickets
- Efficient aggregation for workload statistics
- Uses Prisma's relation loading

### Client-Side:
- React state management for dropdown
- Debouncing on search (if implemented)
- Optimistic UI updates with router.refresh()
- Automatic cleanup on unmount

### API:
- Response caching possible (future enhancement)
- Pagination for large user lists (future enhancement)
- Background sync for real-time updates (future enhancement)

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Real-time updates** - WebSocket for live workload changes
2. **Advanced metrics** - Resolution rate, customer satisfaction
3. **Scheduling** - Round-robin auto-assignment
4. **Notifications** - Email/Slack when assigned
5. **Workload limits** - Prevent overload
6. **Skills-based routing** - Match tickets to expertise
7. **Availability calendar** - Out-of-office handling
8. **Assignment rules** - Automated assignment logic
9. **Performance dashboard** - Team analytics
10. **Historical data** - Assignment history tracking

## 📝 Notes

### Server/Client Component Architecture:
The integration carefully manages React Server Component boundaries:
- **Server Components:** Page files (fetch data, handle auth)
- **Client Wrapper:** TicketAssignmentClient (handles interactivity)
- **Client Component:** UserAssignmentDropdown (dropdown UI)

This architecture provides:
- ✅ Better performance (server-side rendering)
- ✅ Smaller client bundle
- ✅ Proper data fetching
- ✅ Interactive UI where needed

### Data Flow:
```
Server Component (Page)
  ↓ fetch assignedUser
  ↓ pass as props
Client Wrapper (TicketAssignmentClient)
  ↓ manage state
  ↓ handle API calls
  ↓ pass callbacks
Interactive Component (UserAssignmentDropdown)
  ↓ user interaction
  ↓ trigger assignment
  ↓ callback to wrapper
Wrapper refreshes page
  ↓ router.refresh()
Server Component refetches data
```
