# 🎯 Steps 5-6: API & Page Integration - COMPLETE! ✅

## ✅ What We've Built (Steps 5-6)

### **Step 5: Enhanced API Route** ✅
**File:** `app/api/support/route.ts`

**Complete Filter Logic Implementation:**
- ✅ **Text Search** - Searches subject, customerName, customerEmail (case-insensitive)
- ✅ **Status Filter** - Multi-select with IN clause
- ✅ **Priority Filter** - Multi-select with IN clause  
- ✅ **Tags Filter** - Searches comma-separated tags field
- ✅ **Category Filter** - Multi-select categories
- ✅ **Assignment Filters**:
  - `myTickets` - Filters by current user ID
  - `unassigned` - Shows tickets with null assignedToUserId
  - `assignedTo` - Shows tickets assigned to specific users
- ✅ **Customer Email Filter** - Contains search
- ✅ **Source Filter** - Multi-select sources (EMAIL, MANUAL, etc.)
- ✅ **Archived Filter** - Shows/hides archived tickets
- ✅ **Unread Filter** - Shows tickets with unreadCount > 0
- ✅ **Date Range Filters** - Supports 4 date types:
  - `created` - Filter by createdAt
  - `updated` - Filter by updatedAt
  - `resolved` - Filter by resolvedAt
  - `due` - Filter by dueDate
- ✅ **Overdue Filter** - Shows tickets where dueDate < now AND status not RESOLVED/CLOSED
- ✅ **Smart Sorting** - Priority DESC (urgent first), then updatedAt DESC (recent first)
- ✅ **Stats Calculation** - Returns counts for quick filters:
  - Total filtered tickets
  - Urgent/Critical count
  - Overdue count
  - Unassigned count
  - My tickets count

**API Response:**
```typescript
{
  conversations: Conversation[],  // Filtered tickets
  stats: {
    total: number,
    urgent: number,
    overdue: number,
    unassigned: number,
    myTickets: number
  },
  filters: FilterObject  // Echo back active filters
}
```

### **Step 6: Page Integration** ✅
**Files:**
- `components/support/support-tickets-client.tsx` - Client component
- `app/(dashboard)/support/page.tsx` - Updated server page

**Features Implemented:**

**1. Client Component (support-tickets-client.tsx):**
- ✅ Uses `useTicketFilters` hook for state management
- ✅ Auto-fetches tickets when filters change
- ✅ Displays loading states with spinner
- ✅ Shows "No results" message when no tickets match
- ✅ Extracts available tags from ticket data
- ✅ Passes stats to TicketFiltersBar for quick filter counts
- ✅ Renders ticket cards with:
  - Subject
  - Status badge (color-coded)
  - Priority badge (color-coded)
  - Customer name/email
  - Last updated timestamp
  - Unread count indicator
- ✅ Clickable cards navigate to ticket detail
- ✅ Dark mode support throughout

**2. Server Page Updates:**
- ✅ Imports SupportTicketsClient component
- ✅ Wraps client component in Card for consistent UI
- ✅ Maintains existing stats cards at top
- ✅ Keeps archived tickets section separate
- ✅ Server-side session authentication

---

### **Bonus: Tags API** ✅
**File:** `app/api/support/tags/route.ts`

**Endpoints:**
- ✅ `GET /api/support/tags` - List all unique tags for organization
- ✅ `POST /api/support/tags` - Add tag to a ticket
- ✅ `DELETE /api/support/tags?ticketId=X&tag=Y` - Remove tag from ticket

**Features:**
- Deduplicates tags across all tickets
- Sorts tags alphabetically
- Validates ticket ownership (organizationId)
- Handles comma-separated tag storage
- Prevents duplicate tags on same ticket

## 📊 Filter Logic Examples

### **Example 1: Urgent Unassigned Tickets**
```typescript
Filter State:
- priority: ["URGENT", "CRITICAL"]
- unassigned: true

Prisma Query:
{
  organizationId: "...",
  priority: { in: ["URGENT", "CRITICAL"] },
  assignedToUserId: null
}
```

### **Example 2: Overdue Technical Tickets**
```typescript
Filter State:
- categories: ["Technical Support"]
- overdue: true

Prisma Query:
{
  organizationId: "...",
  category: { in: ["Technical Support"] },
  dueDate: { lt: new Date() },
  status: { notIn: ["RESOLVED", "CLOSED"] }
}
```

### **Example 3: Search with Date Range**
```typescript
Filter State:
- search: "refund"
- dateType: "created"
- dateFrom: "2025-10-01"
- dateTo: "2025-10-18"

Prisma Query:
{
  organizationId: "...",
  OR: [
    { subject: { contains: "refund", mode: "insensitive" } },
    { customerName: { contains: "refund", mode: "insensitive" } },
    { customerEmail: { contains: "refund", mode: "insensitive" } }
  ],
  createdAt: {
    gte: new Date("2025-10-01"),
    lte: new Date("2025-10-18")
  }
}
```
